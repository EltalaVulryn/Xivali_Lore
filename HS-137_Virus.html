                Original Purpose
            </h1>
            <p>This virus was originally made to improve the Avali speciesâ€™ eyesight, so they wouldn't have to use echolocation as much as they would normally need to, but the virus unfortunately mutated without its creator Keno realizing it. All until when he was done with it, he left the virus in a freezer overnight because the virus was already completed and ready to be tested, although with a lack of creatures to test it on, he could only test it on himself.</p>
            <h1>Symptoms</h1>
            <p>The next day Xeno went to go test it on himself, because unfortunately no one volunteered. He hesitated for a few seconds knowing there is no going back if anything goes wrong. He finally injected himself with the virus, only until after a few seconds he passed out. He was knocked out cold in a small coma for a few days. This process caused the double helix DNA in his body to become a hexa helix, basically three copies are made from the original double helix formed into one hexa helix. Eventually the body read the DNA and began to fix it, causing the blood to form itself a uranium rich blood, allowing the body to process nuclear fission and fusion. Patterns and stripes would and will occur, while also improving there vision.</p>
